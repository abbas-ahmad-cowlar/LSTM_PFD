title: "LSTM-PFD Bearing Fault Diagnosis Dataset"

description: |
  Synthetic bearing vibration signals for fault diagnosis research.
  Contains 11 fault classes with realistic physics-based simulations
  including ball faults, inner/outer race defects, misalignment,
  imbalance, and oil-related issues.
