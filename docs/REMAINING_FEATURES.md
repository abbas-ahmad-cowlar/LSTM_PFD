## 📝 Technical Debt

### Routes in Sidebar with No Implementation
1. ~~`/datasets`~~ - **FIXED** ✅
2. ~~`/system-health`~~ - **FIXED** ✅
3. ~~`/hpo/campaigns`~~ - **FIXED** ✅

**All critical sidebar routes now functional!** ✅

### Database Models with No UI
1. `webhook_configuration` - Webhooks configured but not manageable
2. `notification_preference` - Notifications work but not configurable (PRIORITY)
3. ~~`hpo_campaign`~~ - **FIXED** ✅
