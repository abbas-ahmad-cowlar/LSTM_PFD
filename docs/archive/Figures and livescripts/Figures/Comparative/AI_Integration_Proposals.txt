=======================================================================

1. CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNN) ON SPECTROGRAMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Treat spectrograms as images for fault classification.

Mathematical Foundation:
  Convolution: (I * K)(x,y) = ΣΣ I(x+i, y+j) · K(i,j)
  where I = input spectrogram, K = learned kernel

Architecture Recommendation:
  - Input: 224x224 spectrogram image
  - Conv layers: 32 → 64 → 128 filters
  - Pooling: Max pooling 2x2
  - Dense: 256 → 11 classes

Expected Improvement: +3-5% accuracy over traditional ML

2. LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY (LSTM) NETWORKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Sequence modeling of raw vibration time series.

Mathematical Foundation:
  Forget gate: f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
  Input gate:  i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
  Cell state:  C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
  Output:      h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)

Use Case: Capture temporal dependencies in fault progression.

3. AUTOENCODER ANOMALY DETECTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Train on healthy data only, detect anomalies via reconstruction error.

Mathematical Foundation:
  Encoder: z = f_enc(x) = σ(W_e · x + b_e)
  Decoder: x̂ = f_dec(z) = σ(W_d · z + b_d)
  Loss: L = ||x - x̂||² (MSE reconstruction error)
  Anomaly score: If L > threshold → Fault detected

Advantage: No labeled fault data required for training.

4. ATTENTION MECHANISMS (TRANSFORMER)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Learn which time/frequency regions are most relevant.

Mathematical Foundation:
  Attention: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) · V
  Self-attention allows the model to focus on fault-relevant regions.

Benefit: Explainable AI - visualize attention weights.

5. TRANSFER LEARNING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Pre-train on large vibration datasets, fine-tune for PFD.

Strategy:
  - Use pre-trained CNN (ResNet, VGG) on ImageNet
  - Replace final layers for 11-class PFD classification
  - Fine-tune with labeled PFD spectrograms

Expected: Faster convergence, better generalization.

6. PHYSICS-INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS (PINNs)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Incorporate bearing physics into neural network loss.

Mathematical Foundation:
  Total Loss = L_data + λ · L_physics
  L_physics encodes Reynolds equation, Sommerfeld number constraints.

Innovation: Novel research direction combining ML with tribology.

7. DOMAIN ADAPTATION (SIM-to-REAL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach: Transfer knowledge from synthetic to real sensor data.

Techniques:
  - Adversarial domain adaptation (align feature distributions)
  - Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss
  - Cycle-consistent GAN for domain translation

Critical for production deployment with real sensors.
